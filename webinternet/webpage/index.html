            <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons.
            It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions.
            JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), 
            it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.
            <ul>                
                <li><a href="index.html">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - 
                imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value.
                All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.
                These unique names are called identifiers. <span>var x;</span></li>
                <li><a href="index.html">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables -
                our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold.
                The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span>var x= 10;</span></li>
                <li><a href="index.html">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; 
                to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. 
                There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: 
                Boolean, - <span>true</span> or <span>false;</span> 
                null - <span>null</span> aka nothing; 
                Number - <span>42</span> or <span>3.14159;</span>
                String - <span>"Coding Dojo Rocks!;"</span>
                Array - <span>[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span>
                and Object - <span>{first_name:'Jane',last_name:'Doe'}</span>
                </li>
                <li><a href="index.html">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - 
                hitting different code blocks based on values or conditionals that have been met.
                You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. 
                There are the following conditional statements: 
                <span>if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; 
                <span>else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; 
                <span>else</span> we execute this block of code;</li>
                <li><a href="index.html">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, 
                but essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times.
                Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop.
                That's a loop!</li>
                <li><a href="index.html">Functions</a> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. 
                When we call our function this will run that code block.
                Think of it as a list of instructions. 
                As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea,
                we open the instruction manual and get started,
                first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table right way up. Done!
                We finished out instructions. 
                Sadly there a a ton more table to do so lets call our function over and over again.</li>
